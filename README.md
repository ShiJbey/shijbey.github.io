# ShiJBey.github.io

This is my portfolio website. This version of the site is built using
Webpack. The last version of the site was built using GatsbyJS. However,
using React for the entire website was overkill and made it much more
difficult to integrate various web demos of projects.

## Project structure

```text
ğŸ“¦shijbey.github.io
â”£ ğŸ“‚dist                // (Autogenerated by Webpack)
â”£ ğŸ“‚pages               // HTML pages
â”£ ğŸ“‚src                 // TypeScript source code
â”£ ğŸ“‚static              // Images and other static assets
â”ƒ â”£ ...
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œfavicon.ico
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œrobots.txt
â”£ ğŸ“œpackage.json
â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
â”£ ğŸ“œtsconfig.json
â”£ ğŸ“œwebpack.common.js   // Shared webpack settings
â”£ ğŸ“œwebpack.dev.js      // Webpack development settings
â”— ğŸ“œwebpack.prod.js     // Webpack production settings
```

## Running the development server

```commandline
yarn start
```

This starts a new Webpack development server at `http://localhost:9000`.

## Building the website

```commandline
yarn build
```

This creates a new production build of the website using `webpack.prod.js`.

## Deploying the website

```commandline
yarn deploy
```

The command above deploys the website GitHub Pages using the
[gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
module.
