We present a framework for\ncategorizing the various techniques used in these games according to\nthe interaction between the world model and the quest model. Using\nthis framework we generalize recent games to present a more dynamic\nworld model, and investigate extensions to the quest model to support\nstorytelling through adaptive quest narratives.</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</p>\n<h3>24, May, 2021</h3>\n<h4>Loide: A web-based IDE for logic programming preliminary report</h4>\n<p><strong>Citation</strong>: Germano, Stefano, Francesco Calimeri, and Eliana Palermiti.\n<em>“Loide: A web-based IDE for logic programming preliminary report.”</em>\nIn International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative\nLanguages, pp. 152-160.

I am a fan of the presentation and the fact\nthat it is web-based. At the tie of writing this I don’t know any logic\nprograming, so I wasn’t able to thoroughly test the interface.\nSomething that I always take for grated in my writing is giving credit\nto the various packages that I use. I always assume that the people\nwho care will look at the code, but I think that mentality is wrong.\nI liked that they included a list of the major packages and a short\ndescription.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Paper Reading Blog","date":"November 09, 2021","description":"My thoughts on research papers that I've read."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/raid_ai/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Raid AI"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/cool_packages/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Projects I want to try and Cool Packages"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4431f660-4320-5624-a1b1-8d5b126ecd74","previousPostId":"06ab3f48-97bf-5297-9e3c-79bb507a391e","nextPostId":"c8aa4fdc-c9fa-5448-bcc7-f5e612ca0643"}},
