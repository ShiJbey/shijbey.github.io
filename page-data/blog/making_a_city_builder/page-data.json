Their version gives the player insight into both the thought of characters as well as some of the recent events in their lives. Players may choose to follow these characters to get more updates. Also, they can get a feel for if the character like them or not based on if the that character follows them on the virtual Twitter platform. I am interested to see how this plays out in the future as <em>Silicon Valley</em> is further developed.</p>\n<p><em>Sim City 2000</em> used a newspaper system that narrativized events in the town and sprinkles them with natural language. It gives the player an understanding of the general sentiment of the city’s population.</p>\n<h2>Optimization and Future Work</h2>\n<p>I am really excited to convert the codebase over to something more performant than python. Rust is my number-one candidate right now because of its memory safety and bindings for both Python and JavaScript. At the end of the day, I want this project to be accessible to as many people as want to use it. I think Rust puts this project in a good position to be just that.</p>\n<p>Along with moving to rust here are some crates that I am interested in trying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/specs\">specs</a> - Entity Component System</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/anymap\">anymap</a> - Value store</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/slotmap\">slotmap</a> - Persistent unique keys to access stored values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I heard about these while watching Catherine West’s keynote at Rust Conf 2018, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M&#x26;ab_channel=Rust\">“Using Rust For Game Development”</a>.</p>\n<h2>Nov 11, 2021</h2>\n<p>I have started prototyping what an ECS version of <em>Talk of the Town</em> would look like. I was waiting to do this port, but I have concluded that the ECS pattern is going to make my life easier in the end when we need to perform story sifting on the data. ECS naturally lays out information in a way that is modular and easily stored in a database. All the structurally related information is stored together in an array, and each component is mapped to a unique ID. I started adding unique IDs to things already and decoupling things by using IDs instead of references. That was a really good decision on my behalf because it is making this very easy. The main thing that I need to remember is that Entities are not containers. They are only lookup indices for the collections of components.</p>\n<p><em><strong>ECS Compliant Talk of the Town Classes</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>City, CityFactory, *All the classes in <code class=\"language-text\">talktown.city.layout.py</code></li>\n<li>SimulationDateTime</li>\n<li>All the routine classes in <code class=\"language-text\">talktown.person.routine</code></li>\n<li>Status, Status Manager</li>\n<li>Relationship, RelationshipManager</li>\n<li>ActivityRecord, ActivityTracker</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a City Builder using Python","date":"November 09, 2021","description":"Record of lessons learned and design decisions during my journey developing my first city builder game.
