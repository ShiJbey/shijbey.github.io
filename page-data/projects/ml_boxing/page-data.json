I had tossed around the idea of using machine learning to\r\ntrain AI agents in fighting games, but I had never gotten around to it\r\nuntil then. The agents learn via Reinforcement Learning and are given\r\na simple policy that positively rewards landed punches on the opponent,\r\nand negatively awards taking damage. Other behaviors such as successful\r\nblocking, and advancing on the opponent are rewarded as well.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ShiJbey/Ml-Agent-Boxing\">Github Repo</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ML-Agent Boxing","date":"January 01, 2020","description":"I threw this project together over the course of a week as an entry in Unity's first challenge for their new 'Ml-Agents' machine learning workflow."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/infiniforge/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Infiniforge"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/vr_erp/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Auditory Brain-Computer Interface for VR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6b1f91d1-e62a-5a4e-8069-00aeeafcf478","previousPostId":"82e24181-13b7-5a76-a021-73357a743b0e","nextPostId":"495ca3b9-2576-5f9b-a65d-8b28f0522a9d"}},
