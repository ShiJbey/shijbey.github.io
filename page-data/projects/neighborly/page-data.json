You can think\nof it as something similar to the world generation phase of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> or the planet\ngeneration in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It simulates\nthe lives of each character, their jobs, routines, relationships, and life events. Neighborly utilizes\nan entity-component system architecture, and enables users to specify custom character types, businesses,\noccupations, life events, and AI components and simulation systems. Neighborly has\ngone through many phases and has suffered its fair share of feature creep. It started off as a refactor of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown\"><em>Talk of the Town</em></a>, but it quickly grew into\nmuch more as a I started replacing various bits of code and pulling out the major parts\nthat I wanted to keep.</p>\n<h2>What is the current status of Neighborly?</h2>\n<p>The build available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/neighborly/\">PyPI</a> (0.9.0) is broken. I made that\nrelease to reserve the name. I planned on having a fully functional version by the spring time, but\nit is currently summer 2022 and a 1.0.0 release is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<h2>What is neighborly for?</h2>\n<p>Neighborly does not have an experience that it targets. I have gone back and forth between many\ndifferent game genres, but I have not found anything that quite fits. NEighborly sits somewhere\nbetween a character-focused city-builder and a life simulator game. At one point I have considered\nboth these genres as potential targets. Currently, life simulator seems to be the easiest to\ncreate a GUI for. However, the life simulator hides all the interesting life stories of the other\ncharacters in the town. Another potential direction is to let people generate towns and read the\ntranscripts of events that have transpired between visits.</p>\n<p>Neighborly is a social simulation engine for procedurally generating towns of characters.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly\">GitHub Repo</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Neighborly","date":"May 24, 2022","description":"Customizable Social Simulation Framework for making Talk of the Town-likes"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/centrifuge/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Centrifuge"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b438b7f1-7755-53ab-af92-19f3fa37a1da","previousPostId":"f49d4296-c2a0-5488-aaaa-87f7f35ea002","nextPostId":null}},
