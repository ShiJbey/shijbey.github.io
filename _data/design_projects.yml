- name: 'EXAG 2022 Workshop Stickers'
  summary: >
      I made these stickers using Procreate on iPad for the 2022 EXAG
      Workshop I organized. The theme of the conference was
      "Mis-spun Tales," encouraging people to submit work that yielded unintended or negative
      results. I wanted to make a sticker that
      reflected the spirit of story tales. Of course, I had to
      sprinkle on some mystical and technological vibes.

  summary: >
      Unless otherwise attributed, I am the creator of all the art
      on <a href="https://jyackl.com">Jyackl.com</a>. I created
      art as I need it during development. Something that I really
      wanted was vector graphic-style black characters. So I made
      my own reusable library of head shapes, hairstyles, and skin
      tones.

- name: 'The Blacklist DMV Logo and Apparel'
  summary: >
      During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, my partner and I started
      The Blacklist DMV, a social media account devoted to showcasing
      Black-owned businesses in Washington D.C., Maryland, and
      Virginia (the DMV area). I couldn't pass up the
      opportunity to give us a cool logo and shirts. The logo combines
      the Pan-African red-black-and-green flag, a list icon,
      and a map pin to represent our mission.

- name: Carnegie Mellon Research Lab Logo
  summary: >
      While I was a student at Carnegie Mellon University,
      I designed a logo for our research group. We were the
      Neural Web Research Group, named after the
      brain-computer interface research that we did. We had the logo printed as a laptop sticker
      and embroidered it
      on lab jackets (not pictured).
