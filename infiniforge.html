            <p>
                I started designing this project in 2016. At the time, I was
                heavily interested in both blacksmithing and procedural
                generation. I didn't know anything about
                computer graphics or PCG when I started. So, this project served as my
                introduction to both of those. Over the past three years,
                this project has helped me to grow more as a programmer. I continue
                to add to Infiniforge, even though it was to be submitted for the
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/4wubjy/monthly_challenge_9_august_2016_procedural_weapons/"
                    rel="none">August 2016 /procedural_generation subreddit challenge</a>.
                Infiniforge is a NodeJS module that generates and exports 3D meshes
                (using ThreeJs) as glTF JSON. The models can be
                imported into Unity or other software that supports the
                format.
                <br>
                This project went through many past iterations. The first working
                demo used Blender python scripts to generate 3D geometry in
                Blender. However, I eventually removed Blender from the system and
                moved the geometry generation to JavaScript/Typescript. This new
                approach greatly reduced the dependencies needed to run the
                application.
                <br>
                The edges of the sword are generated by modifying a spline and then
                sampling the spline at different resolutions. Moreover, I created a
                special web tool for creating and editing the blade cross-sections
                used during generation.
                <br>
                All code is available on
                <a href="https://github.com/ShiJbey/Infiniforge">GitHub</a>.
                The demo above lets people get a feel for the output before
                downloading Infiniforge from npm. Feel free to play with the
                different generation parameters. If you find a sword you like,
                export it as glTF. You could even 3D print the model (after some
                rescaling).
