I saw this format on Mark J. Nelson's [site](https://www.kmjn.org/paperlog/),
and I really liked how it was organized. So, this is my attempt at
reverse-engineering his paper reading log.

#### Towards adaptive quest narrative in shared, persistent virtual worlds

**Citation**: Tomai, Emmett. "Towards adaptive quest narrative in shared, persistent
virtual worlds." In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial
Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment, vol. 8, no. 1. 2012.

**Tags**: interactive narrative, quest generation

**Abstract**: In this paper, we discuss motivations for studying interactive
narrative in shared, persistent worlds using the established
conventions of quest-based MMORPGs. We present a framework for
categorizing the various techniques used in these games according to
the interaction between the world model and the quest model. Using
this framework we generalize recent games to present a more dynamic
world model, and investigate extensions to the quest model to support
storytelling through adaptive quest narratives.

#### Loide: A web-based IDE for logic programming preliminary report

**Citation**: Germano, Stefano, Francesco Calimeri, and Eliana Palermiti.
_"Loide: A web-based IDE for logic programming preliminary report."_
In International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative
Languages, pp. 152-160. Springer, Cham, 2018.

**Tags**: logic programming, technical report, ASP, WebIDE

**Abstract**:
Logic-based paradigms are nowadays widely used in many different
fields, also thank to the availability of robust tools and systems
that allow the development of real-world and industrial applications.
In this work we present LoIDE, an advanced and modular web-editor for
logic-based languages that also integrates with state-of-the-art
solvers.

**Thoughts**:
This was an cool project. I am a fan of the presentation and the fact
that it is web-based. At the tie of writing this I don't know any logic
programing, so I wasn't able to thoroughly test the interface.
Something that I always take for grated in my writing is giving credit
to the various packages that I use. I always assume that the people
who care will look at the code, but I think that mentality is wrong.
I liked that they included a list of the major packages and a short
description.
