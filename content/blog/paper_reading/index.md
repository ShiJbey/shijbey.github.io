<h1>Paper Readings</h1>
    <p>
      I saw this format on Mark J. Nelson's
      <a href="https://www.kmjn.org/paperlog/">site</a>, and I really liked how
      it was organized. So, this is my attempt at reverse-engineering his paper
      reading log.

        <blockquote>
          Logic-based paradigms are nowadays widely used in many different
          fields, also thank to the availability of robust tools and systems
          that allow the development of real-world and industrial applications.
          In this work we present LoIDE, an advanced and modular web-editor for
          logic-based languages that also integrates with state-of-the-art
          solvers.

          This was an cool project. I am a fan of the presentation and the fact
          that it is web-based. At the tie of writing this I dont know any logic
          programing, so I wasn't able to thoroughly test the interface.
          Something that I always take for grated in my writing is giving credit
          to the varioius packages that I use. I always assume that the people
          who care will look at the code, but I think that mentallity is wrong.
          I liked that they included a list of the major packages and a short
          description.

        <p>Abstract:</p>
        <blockquote>
          In this paper, we discuss motivations for studying interactive
          narrative in shared, persistent worlds using the established
          conventions of quest-based MMORPGs. We present a framework for
          categorizing the various techniques used in these games according to
          the interaction between the world model and the quest model. Using
          this framework we generalize recent games to present a more dynamic
          world model, and investigate extensions to the quest model to support
          storytelling through adaptive quest narratives.
