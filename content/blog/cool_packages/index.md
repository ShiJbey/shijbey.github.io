## Projects I want to try

### Creating a VS Code extension

Not sure what the extension would do, but I think that it is
important to consider building tools for the most popular
cross-platform programming environment. Here is the [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

### Implement a logical knowledge base like Prolog for projects

## Cool Node Packages

Here are some cool packages I've come across in the wild. I am documenting
them here so that I remember for future projects

### [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

Sync updates across multiple open browser windows when testing web
applications

### [JISON](https://github.com/zaach/jison)

This is a JavaScript port of
[GNU Bison]("https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/"). It is a
library for generating parsers using context-free grammars.

The project seems kind of dead. There has not been any major
releases to the npm registry in about 4 years (as of this post).

I would love to have time to either update this project to
Typescript or convert it to Rust and port to WASM.
