<p>
      Here are some cool packages I've come across in the wild. I am documenting
      them here so that I remember for future projects
    </p>

    <h1>Projects I want to try</h1>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h2>Creating a VS Code extension</h2>
          <p>
            Not sure what the extension would do, but I think that it is
            important to consider building tools for the most popular
            cross-platform programming environment. Here is the
            <a
              href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension"
              >tutorial</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Cool Node Packages</h1>

    <ul class="package-list">
      <li>
        <div>
          <h2><a href="https://www.browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a></h2>
          <p>
            Sync updates across multiple open browser windows when testing web
            applications
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h2><a href="https://github.com/zaach/jison">JISON</a></h2>
          <p>
            This is a JavaScript port of
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">GNU Bison</a>. It is a
            library for generating parsers using context-free grammars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project seems kind of dead. There has not been any major
            releases to the npm registry in about 4 years (as of this post).
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to have time to either update this project to
            Typescript or convert it to Rust and port to WASM.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
