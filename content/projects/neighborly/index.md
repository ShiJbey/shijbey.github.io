Neighborly is a social simulation engine for procedurally generating towns of characters. It simulates
the lives of each character, their jobs, routines, relationships, and life events. Neighborly utilizes
an entity-component system architecture, and enables users to specify custom character types, businesses,
occupations, life events, and AI components and simulation systems.

Neighborly takes lessons learned from working with
[_Talk of the Town_](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)
and aims to give people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more opportunities for extension and content authoring.

<b>Neighborly is not fully functional yet. I am actively working toward a working release.</b>
