# Infiniforge

I started this project in 2016 as an effort to learn more about procedural content generation and computer graphics. The then-upcoming release of No Man's Sky and my interest in blacksmithing inspired me to pursue this. My goal was to submit it to the r/proceduralgeneration subreddit challenge linked below. Since then, I have continuously tinkered with this project in my free time. Infiniforge is a NodeJs server that exports 3D meshes (using ThreeJs) as glTF JSON via a REST API. After exporting the models, they can then be imported into Unity or any other software that supports the glTF format.
